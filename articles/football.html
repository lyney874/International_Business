    <h1>HoYoverse: How China Became Number One in the Industry</h1>
    <p>HoYoverse is a company you’ve definitely seen, even if you’ve never played their games. When they were just a small indie studio, they were called miHoYo, but now they’re the world - famous HoYoverse. MiHoYo was founded in 2012 by three students, starting with the development of the mobile game FlyMe2theMoon for iOS. Although FlyMe2theMoon was just a small casual game, it laid the foundation for the Honkai universe, which can be found in the studio’s later games. With the release of Genshin Impact in 2020, miHoYo became a global sensation. This action-RPG with an open world and a free-to-play model attracted a massive audience and brought the company enormous popularity and revenue.</p>
    <p>In 2022, miHoYo announced the creation of the new brand HoYoverse to unite its entertainment products and its ambition to build global virtual worlds. Thus, miHoYo, which started with small mobile projects, managed to achieve worldwide fame and recognition, becoming one of the industry’s leading game developers. HoYoverse represents a new stage in the company’s development, aimed at expanding its influence on the global entertainment market.</p>
    <p>Today, HoYoverse is one of the biggest names in Chinese game development. Their projects (Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, Zenless Zone Zero) attract millions of players, earn billions, and set trends that even Western studios try to follow. China in game development is not something of the future - it’s the present. Tencent, NetEase, Lilith, Papergames, HoYoverse - these names define the industry right now. If someone still thinks that the gaming scene is only Japan, the USA, and Europe, they’re stuck in the 2010s. China is here. China is leading. And most likely, you’re already playing their games - you just haven’t thought about it.</p>

    <h1>China’s Expansion in Game Development</h1>
    <p>China is no longer just catching up - it’s taking the lead. Over the past 10 years, Chinese companies have gone from local mobile games to global hits on the same level as console and PC titles. They buy studios, enter the Western market, and invest in cloud technologies, AI, and game design.</p>
    <p>It’s expected that the Chinese gaming industry will grow from $66.13 billion in 2024 to $95.51 billion by 2029, with an average annual growth rate of 7.63% during the forecast period (2024–2029). China is one of the most profitable markets for the gaming industry. Several international companies are entering the market by acquiring shares in Chinese game providers or sponsoring professional eSports teams.</p>
    <p>One of the main reasons for the growth of the gaming industry in China is the rapidly increasing popularity of eSports - the competitive side of the gaming industry where various players participate in tournaments streamed online. As Chinese companies are ready to seize the opportunities of global digitalization, businesses throughout the region are applying digital transformation across their entire production cycle, particularly to improve efficiency.</p>
    <p>For example, Tencent Games announced seven projects in June, including collaborations in game technologies. These include the Digital Great Wall of China, the Library Cave in Dunhuang, the Central Axis of Beijing, the Chasing All Transients Constellation Hunters (CATCH) program, a full-flight simulator (FFS), a complete digital 3D factory, and a gaming playground.</p>
    <p>Tencent owns Riot Games (League of Legends), parts of Epic Games, Supercell, Ubisoft, and dozens of others. NetEase buys Western developers in batches. HoYoverse creates “free” games that surpass AAA competitors in quality. But the Chinese aim for more - they want not just money but respect. And here comes the project that changes everything: <strong>Black Myth: Wukong</strong>.</p>
    <p>The announcement of this game hit Western game developers like a shockwave. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, featuring combat on par with Souls-like games, and based on uncompromising Chinese mythology, this isn’t just a game - it’s a statement: “China can make AAA.” And they’re doing it.</p>

    <h1>What’s Next for Chinese Game Development?</h1>
    <p>We’re about to see expansion not only into mobile games but also into consoles, single-player games, VR, and AI. Chinese studios are starting to create games that don’t just look “like they’re from China” - they look like the future of the industry. And while China used to be associated with copycats and heavy monetization, now it’s setting the standards.</p>

    <h1>The Chinese Style</h1>
    <p>China has found its formula for success - and applies it with precision. At the core - gacha. It’s not just a mechanic - it’s a whole cult. You don’t just play, you pray for your favorite pixelated anime-eyed hero. Or waifu. Or both. Preferably with a banner that expires in 2 days.</p>
    <p>Next come the daily quests. In a Chinese game, you’re not just a player - you’re an employee. Every day: log in, report in, kill 3 enemies, open 2 chests, touch some grass. This isn’t just gameplay - it’s discipline. Miss a day? You’ll fall behind. And if you fall behind - you’ll suffer.</p>
    <p>Graphics? Always top-notch. HoYoverse, Tencent, Papergames - they seem to hire artists with degrees from the future. Characters, locations, effects - everything looks like a glossy magazine cover. China makes you want to donate money just out of respect for the design.</p>
    <p>Narrative? That’s trickier. The stories are often stretched thin, spanning a hundred hours, and halfway through you forget who’s whose brother and who’s the cursed robot. But everything is epic in tone, with parallel worlds, philosophy, gods, and universe-level catastrophes that must be solved “by tomorrow.”</p>
    <p>Control? It’s everywhere. The Chinese style always has a bit of censorship. No explicit content, no “unpatriotic” themes, and with ideological filtering. It’s noticeable, but players get used to it. Because everything else works like clockwork.</p>
    <p>As a result, the Chinese style means:
    <ul>
      <li>Visuals that drop your jaw;</li>
      <li>Gameplay that exhausts you but keeps you hooked;</li>
      <li>Characters you love and hate at the same time;</li>
      <li>And a system that keeps you in the game every day, even if you don’t know why.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>What’s Next?</h1>
    <p>China has no plans to slow down. What we see now is just the beginning. HoYoverse has a game release schedule planned for years ahead. Tencent and NetEase invest in VR, AI, and metaverses. Black Myth: Wukong promises to shatter stereotypes about “Chinese games” forever.</p>
    <p>The future of Chinese game development is AAA, global reach, and dominance across genres. Gacha, RPG, open world, action, shooters, even platformers - Chinese studios are already nipping at the heels of the West. In some areas, they’re setting the pace.</p>
    <p>But there are risks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oversaturation. Players get tired of repetitive mechanics and templates.</li>
      <li>Government censorship. It can stifle creativity, stories, and experimental formats.</li>
      <li>Huge competition inside China. Studios crush each other, burning the market out.</li>
      <li>Markets outside China aren’t infinite. Europe and the USA are starting to tire of “Asian models.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Still, if China can balance quality, freedom, and business, its dominance in game development will only grow stronger. HoYoverse has already become both a meme and a standard. It’s both a diagnosis and a role model. And whether we like it or not - the future belongs to them.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>HoYoverse is not just a studio but a symbol of an era. It shows how China didn’t just enter the global gaming industry but took control of it. Their games provoke both admiration and criticism, love and hate - and that’s exactly what makes them so significant.</p>
    <p>Chinese game development is not “tomorrow” or “soon” - it’s today. Games from China set the standards, dictate trends, and influence millions of players worldwide.</p>
    <p>If you’re a gamer, a developer, or just an observer, you should keep a close eye on how this giant industry is evolving - because the next global hit that changes the rules of the game is likely to come from China.</p>
