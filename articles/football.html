  <h1>HoYoverse: How China Became Number One in the Industry</h1>
  <p>HoYoverse is a company you’ve definitely seen, even if you’ve never played their games. When they were just a small indie studio, they were called miHoYo, but now they’re the world - famous HoYoverse. MiHoYo was founded in 2012 by three students, starting with the development of the mobile game FlyMe2theMoon for iOS. Although FlyMe2theMoonwas just a small casual game, it laid the foundation for the Honkai universe, which can be found in the studio’s later games. With the release of Genshin Impact in 2020, miHoYo became a global sensation. This action-RPG with an open world and a free-to-play model attracted a massive audience and brought the company enormous popularity and revenue.</p>
  <p>In 2022, miHoYo announced the creation of the new brand HoYoverse to unite its entertainment products and its ambition to build global virtual worlds. Thus, miHoYo, which started with small mobile projects, managed to achieve worldwide fame and recognition, becoming one of the industry’s leading game developers. HoYoverse represents a new stage in the company’s development, aimed at expanding its influence on the global entertainment market.</p>
  <p>Today, HoYoverse is one of the biggest names in Chinese game development. Their projects (Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, Zenless Zone Zero) attract millions of players, earn billions, and set trends that even Western studios try to follow.</p>
  <p>China in game development is not something of the future - it’s the present. Tencent, NetEase, Lilith, Papergames, HoYoverse - these names define the industry right now. If someone still thinks that the gaming scene is only Japan, the USA, and Europe, they’re stuck in the 2010s. China is here. China is leading. And most likely, you’re already playing their games - you just haven’t thought about it.</p>
