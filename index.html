      <div class="full-article" id="full-article">
        <p>HoYoverse is a company you‚Äôve definitely seen, even if you‚Äôve never played their games. When they were just a small indie studio, they were called miHoYo, but now they‚Äôre the world-famous HoYoverse.</p>

        <p>MiHoYo was founded in 2012 by three students. Starting with the development of the mobile game FlyMe2theMoon for iOS, they eventually built the Honkai universe, which led to their mega-hit: <strong>Genshin Impact</strong>.</p>

        <p>In 2022, miHoYo rebranded as HoYoverse to unify all its products and ambitions into one virtual universe. Their games attract millions of players and generate billions in revenue.</p>

        <p>Chinese game development has exploded. Tencent, NetEase, Lilith, Papergames, and HoYoverse lead the charge, influencing global trends and redefining the industry.</p>

        <p>From gacha mechanics to world-class graphics, Chinese studios now set the bar. HoYoverse, in particular, has become the model of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next‚Äù in gaming.</p>
